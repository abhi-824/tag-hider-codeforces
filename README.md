# Tag Hider Codeforces

This is a very very basic extension and just adds an unhide button in place of tags to your problemsets. I know you can do it from problemset page but the thing is that I want to know the tags after 10-15 min of doing that question. So making an extension for the same seemed easy than to go back then turn on the tags.

Before doing any installation, please be a dear and clone the repository.

## Installation in Chrome

- Just go `chrome://extensions`
- Toggle on the Developer Mode on top right 
- Click on Load unpacked and select the cloned folder

You are ready to go on chrome

## Installation in Mozilla

For people like me who prefer mozilla over chrome due to chrome's high apetite of RAM, Here are the steps
- Go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
- Click on `Load Temporary Add-on`(Yes we are temporaryðŸ˜¢)
- Select `hello.js`

You are ready to go on mozilla also.

Also, if it really helps you, please star this repo so that I could write I have 10+ stars on github and interviewer will just overlook it and ask DSA instead.ðŸ˜¶
